For as long as I can remember, I have always been deeply passioned by technology.
This eventually lead me to study at the **[Swiss Institute of Technology Lausanne](https://epfl.ch/)</a>** (EPFL), where I accomplished a Master degree in [Computer Science](https://www.epfl.ch/schools/ic/education/master/computer-science/).
I am now a **Software Engineer** at [Liip](https://liip.ch/).
Before that, I worked for 7 years at [Nothing](https://nothing.ch/), where I notably took part to the development of [Peerdom](https://peerdom.org/), a platform that helps you visualise and interact with your organisation structure.
